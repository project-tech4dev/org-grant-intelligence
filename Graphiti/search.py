"""Step 3: search the graph built by add_episodes.py.

    python search.py                          # interactive prompt
    python search.py "who works at Dalgo?"    # one-shot

Three search approaches are shown:

1. Hybrid search -- graphiti.search(query)
   BM25 + cosine similarity, merged with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Broad recall.

2. Node distance reranking -- graphiti.search(query, center_node_uuid=...)
   Same hybrid search, then reweighted by graph proximity to a focal entity.
   Use it for entity-specific questions: --focus Jane pulls up Jane's own
   facts ahead of generally-relevant ones.

3. Configurable search -- graphiti.search_(query, config=<recipe>)
   The low-level method. Returns nodes/edges/communities instead of a flat
   fact list, and takes a SearchConfig recipe (see RECIPES below).
   Note: graphiti._search() is the deprecated name for the same thing.
